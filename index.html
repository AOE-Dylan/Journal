        <p>Why I took this class. 
        I took this class because I was interested in the coding and programming skills. I also saw a presentation in the library about what they do with code that also drove my interest</p>
        <p>What I want to get out of this class.
        In this class, I would like to learn how to program and code enough to design my own apps and be able to produce my own ideas.</p></font>
